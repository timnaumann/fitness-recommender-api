<br/>
<strong>Legal basis of the processing of personal data</strong>
<p>In the following we inform you about the legal bases of the processing of personal data:</p>
<ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
    <li>If we have obtained your consent for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO is the
        legal basis.
    </li>
    <li>If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual
        measures taken at your request, Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO is the legal basis.
    </li>
    <li>If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g. legal
        storage obligations), Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. c) DS-GVO is the legal basis.
    </li>
    <li>If the processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person,
        Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. d) DS-GVO is the legal basis.
    </li>
    <li>If the processing is necessary to protect our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party
        and your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms do not override in this respect, then Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1
        lit. f) DS-GVO is the legal basis.
    </li>

</ol>
<br/>
<strong>Transfer of personal data to third parties and processors</strong>
<p>Without your consent, we generally do not pass on any data to third parties. If this should nevertheless be the case,
    then the transfer takes place on the basis of the previously mentioned legal grounds, e.g. in the case of the
    transfer of data to online payment providers for the fulfillment of the contract or due to a court order or because
    of a legal obligation to hand over the data for the purpose of criminal prosecution, to avert danger or to enforce
    intellectual property rights.<br/>
    We also use contract processors (external service providers, e.g. for web hosting of our websites and databases) to
    process your data. If data is passed on to the processors as part of a contract processing agreement, this is always
    done in accordance with Art. 28 DS-GVO. In doing so, we carefully select our processors, regularly monitor them and
    have been granted a right to issue instructions regarding the data. In addition, the processors must have taken
    appropriate technical and organizational measures and comply with the data protection regulations according to BDSG
    n.F. and DS-GVO</p>

<br/>
<strong>Data transfer to third countries</strong>
<p>The adoption of the European General Data Protection Regulation (DS-GVO) has created a uniform basis for data
    protection in Europe. Your data is therefore predominantly processed by companies to which DS-GVO applies. If,
    however, processing is carried out by services of third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic
    Area, these must meet the special requirements of Art. 44 et seq. DS-GVO. This means that the processing takes place
    on the basis of special guarantees, such as the officially recognized determination by the EU Commission of a level
    of data protection corresponding to the EU or the observance of officially recognized special contractual
    obligations, the so-called "standard contractual clauses".<br/>If, due to the ineffectiveness of the so-called.
    "Privacy Shield", according to Art. 49 para. 1 p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO the express consent to the data transfer to the
    U.S. from you, we point in this regard to the risk of secret access by U.S. authorities and the use of the data for
    monitoring purposes, possibly without legal remedies for EU citizens.</p>

<br/>
<strong>Deletion of data and storage period</strong>
<p>Unless expressly stated in this privacy policy, your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the consent
    given for processing is revoked by you or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies or the data is no
    longer required for the purpose, unless their continued storage is necessary for evidentiary purposes or is contrary
    to statutory retention obligations. This includes, for example, retention obligations under commercial law for
    business letters in accordance with Section 257 (1) of the German Commercial Code (HGB) (6 years) and retention
    obligations under tax law for receipts in accordance with Section 147 (1) of the German Fiscal Code (AO) (10 years).
    If the prescribed retention period expires, your data will be blocked or deleted, unless the storage is still
    necessary for the conclusion or fulfillment of a contract.</p>


<br/>
<strong>Existence of automated decision making</strong>
<p>We do not use automated decision making or profiling.</p>

<strong>Cookies</strong>
<ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
    <li>We use so-called cookies when you visit our website. Cookies are small text files that your Internet browser
        places and stores on your computer. When you visit our website again, these cookies provide information to
        automatically recognize you. Cookies also include the so-called "user IDs", where user information is stored by
        means of pseudonymized profiles. For this purpose, we inform you when you call up our website by means of a
        reference to our data protection declaration about the use of cookies for the aforementioned purposes and how
        you can object to this or prevent their storage ("opt-out").<br/><br/>
        <strong>A distinction is made between the following types of cookies:</strong><br/><br/>
        <strong>• Necessary, essential cookies:</strong> Essential cookies are cookies that are absolutely necessary for
        the operation of the website to store certain functions of the website such as logins, shopping cart or user
        input, for example, regarding the language of the website.<br/><br/>
        <strong>• Session cookies:</strong> Session cookies are needed to recognize multiple use of an offer by the same
        user (eg if you have logged in to determine your login status). When you visit our site again, these cookies
        provide information to automatically recognize you. The information thus obtained is used to optimize our offers
        and to provide you with easier access to our site. When you close the browser or you log out, the session
        cookies are deleted.<br/><br/>
        <strong>• Persistent cookies:</strong> These cookies remain stored even after you close the browser. They are
        used to store the login, range measurement and marketing purposes. They are deleted automatically after a
        specified duration, which may differ depending on the cookie. In the security settings of your browser, you can
        delete the cookies at any time.<br/><br/>
        <strong>• Third-party cookies (third-party cookies esp. from advertisers):</strong> According to your wishes,
        you can configure your browser settings and, for example, reject the acceptance of third-party cookies or all
        cookies. However, we would like to point out at this point that you may then not be able to use all the
        functions of this website. Read more about these cookies at the respective privacy statements of the third-party
        providers.<br/><br/>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Data categories:</strong> User data, cookie, user ID (inb. the pages visited, device information, access
        times and IP addresses).<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Purposes of processing:</strong> The information thus obtained is used for the purpose of technically
        and economically optimizing our web offerings and providing you with easier and more secure access to our
        website.<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> If we process your personal data using cookies based on your consent ("opt-in"),
        then Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO is the legal basis. Otherwise, we have a legitimate interest in the effective
        functionality, improvement and economic operation of the website, so that in that case Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
        f) DS-GVO is the legal basis. In addition, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b) DS-GVO, if the cookies
        are set to initiate a contract, e.g. for orders.<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Duration of storage/deletion:</strong> The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary
        to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of
        the website, this is the case when the respective session is ended.<br/><br/>Cookies are otherwise stored on

<strong>Presence on social media</strong>

<ol style="margin:10px 0px; padding:15px;">
    <li>We maintain profiles or fan pages in social media. When you use and access our profile in the respective
        network, the respective privacy notices and terms of use of the respective network apply.<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Data categories and description of data processing:</strong> Usage data, contact data, content data,
        inventory data. Furthermore, the data of users within social networks are usually processed for market research
        and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created based on the usage behavior and resulting
        interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and
        outside the networks that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For these purposes, cookies are
        usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and interests of the users are stored.
        Furthermore, data independent of the devices used by the users may also be stored in the usage profiles
        (especially if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them). For a detailed
        presentation of the respective forms of processing and the options to object (opt-out), we refer to the privacy
        statements and information provided by the operators of the respective networks. In the case of requests for
        information and the assertion of data subject rights, we also point out that these can be asserted most
        effectively with the providers. Only the providers have access to the users' data and can take appropriate
        measures and provide information directly. If you still need help, then you can contact us.<br/><br/></li>


    <li><strong>Purpose of processing:</strong> Communication with the users connected and registered on the social
        networks; Information and advertising for our products, offers and services; External presentation and image
        maintenance; Evaluation and analysis of the users and content of our presences in the social media.<br/><br/>

    <li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> The legal basis for the processing of personal data is our legitimate interest in
        the above purposes pursuant to Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. f) DS-GVO. Insofar as you have given us or the responsible
        party of the social network consent to the processing of your personal data, the legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1
        p. 1 lit. a) in conjunction with. Art. 7 DS-GVO.<br/><br/></li>
