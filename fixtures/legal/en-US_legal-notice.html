§ 1 Content warning<br />
The free and freely accessible contents of this website were created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the free and freely accessible information provided. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. The mere fact of accessing the free and freely accessible content does not create any contractual relationship between the user and the provider; in this respect, the provider's intention to be legally bound is lacking.
The content of mindyourposture.ai is intended for information purposes only. Always contact a doctor or sports physician before starting any exercises.  
Mindyourposture.ai cannot be a substitute for professional help from doctors. If you have health problems, the provider urges you to consult a doctor.

§ 2 External links<br />
This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the third-party content for any legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. It is not reasonable for the provider to constantly monitor the external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, upon knowledge of legal violations, such external links will be deleted immediately.<br />
